## Analysis
> ðŸš§: You can reuse the analysis (you made) from other projects (e.g., requirement engineering), but it must be submitted according to the following template. 

In today's academic curriculum, students are often faced with the dilemma what to do with their accumulated school materials, such as textbooks, notebooks, related equipment, digital resources and many more. These become obsolete and frequently go unused, which leads to unnecessary waste and a financial strain for new students looking into purchasing them in full price. 

### Scenario (question: how long should the analysis introduction be?) 

FHNW Thrift is an online markeplace for students at FHNW to resell studying material and other things. Through the platform, students, teachers and other individuals that are within the FHNW organization are allowed to create offers and sell their items. Users are also allowed report malicious offerings to avoid fraud, which the administrators of the program will also be able to delete and alert the users about suspicious profiles. This way, the platform remains with only legitimate offers and profiles of individuals within the FHNW organization. 

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to create offers for my fellow students.
2. As a user, I want to filter offers by location.
3. As a user, I want to report suspicious offers to avoid getting scammed.
4. As a user, I want to contact a seller when I am insterested in a product.
5. As a user, I should be able to contact the admin to edit or delete an existing offer.
6. As an admin, I want to modify or delete existing offers.
(7. As an admin, I want to refrain users access in case of user suspicious activities.) 

### Use Case

![](images/use-case.png)

- UC-1 User creates object
- UC-2 Admin changes existing object
- UC-3 Admin deletes object
- UC-4 User can report object as suspicious
- UC-5 Admin can create, edit, delete objects
- UC-6 User can sort by school location, category and condition
- UC-7 User can contact other user through portal
- UC-8 User can contact Admin to edit or delete own offers

- UC-1 [Show all the offers]: Admin can retrieve all the offerings on the database
- UC-2 [Show an offer]: Admin can retrieve the information on a specific offer.
- UC-3 [Create an offer]: User can create an offer.
- UC-4 [Show Location, Condition or Category Offers]: User can retrieve specific offers by location, category or condition.

## Design
> ðŸš§: Keep in mind the Corporate Identity (CI); you shall decide appropriately the color schema, graphics, typography, layout, User Experience (UX), and so on.

The design has been sketched through drawio and is currently being created in Budibase.

### Wireframe

The wireframe is created through drawio in order to visualize what is being planned for the prototype to look like. 
LInk: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aJUydp2JTiglDqXS5bhqTPHjDJ3wwXQq/view?usp=sharing ](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1EdAtBRFfmMlq_bZgUat0rvuNs8qZ22Bt#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%226ppb-k3glDpuP1GKOrRW%22%7D)

### Prototype

The prototype is currently being created through Budibase.

### Domain Design (still to be done) 
> ðŸš§: Provide a picture and describe your domain model; you may use Entity-Relationship Model or UML class diagram. Both can be created in Visual Paradigm - we have an academic license for it.

(The `ch.fhnw.pizza.data.domain` package contains the following domain objects / entities including getters and setters:

### Business Logic 

Based on the UC-4 and UC-5, there will be the opportunity that the user can report a post and the Admin to delete it and also take measures to act on this report. 

- If the offer on the platform looks suspicious, the user is allowed to report it through a "Report!" button to the Admin. 
- If the offer on the platform looks suspicious, the Admin is allowed to delete the post and either warn or ban the user from creating new posts. 

**Path**: (path for the business logic to be still attached)

**Param**: (parameter for the business logic to be still attached)

**Method:** `GET`

## Implementation (still to be done) 
> ðŸš§: Briefly describe your technology stack, which apps were used and for what.

### Backend Technology (still to be done) 
> ðŸš§: It is suggested to clone this repository, but you are free to start from fresh with a Spring Initializr. If so, describe if there are any changes to the PizzaRP e.g., different dependencies, versions & etc... Please, also describe how your database is set up. If you want a persistent or in-memory H2 database check [link](https://github.com/FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/blob/main/pizza/src/main/resources/application.properties). If you have placeholder data to initialize at the app, you may use a variation of the method **initPlaceholderData()** available at [link](https://github.com/FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/blob/main/pizza/src/main/java/ch/fhnw/pizza/PizzaApplication.java).

This Web application is relying on [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) and the following dependencies:

- [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data)
- [Java Persistence API (JPA)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)
- [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com)

To bootstrap the application, the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) has been used.

Then, the following further dependencies have been added to the project `pom.xml`:

- DB:
```XML
<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

- SWAGGER:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
      <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
```

### Frontend Technology (still to be done) 
> ðŸš§: Describe your views and what APIs is used on which view. If you don't have access to the Internet Technology class Budibase environment(https://inttech.budibase.app/), please write to Devid on MS teams.

This Web application was developed using Budibase and it is available for preview at https://inttech.budibase.app/app/pizzeria. 

## Execution (still to be done) 
> ðŸš§: Please describe how to execute your app and what configurations must be changed to run it. 

**The codespace URL of this Repo is subject to change.** Therefore, the Budibase PizzaRP webapp is not going to show any data in the view, when the URL is not updated or the codespace is offline. Follow these steps to start the webservice and reconnect the webapp to the new webservice url. 

1. Clone PizzaRP in a new repository.
2. Start your codespace (see video guide at: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9B7qc9lVc&ab_channel=GitHub))
3. Run the PizzaRP main available at PizzaApplication.java on your own codespace.
4. Set your app with a public port, see the guide at [link](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace).
5. Create an own Budibase app, you can export/import the existing Pizzeria app. Guide available at [link](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/export-and-import-apps).
6. Update the pizzeria URL in the datasource and publish your app.

Project Team's procedure:
1. PizzaRP is cloned in a new repository.
2. Codespace started and copilot used to gather inspiration for the new code for "thrift" as shown in this repository.
3. 

### Deployment to a PaaS
> ðŸš§: Deployment to PaaS is optional but recommended as it will make your application (backend) accessible without server restart and through a unique, constantly available link.  

Alternatively, you can deploy your application to a free PaaS like [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/register).
1. Refer to the Dockerfile inside the application root (FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/pizza).
2. Adapt line 13 to the name of your jar file. The jar name should be derived from the details in the pom.xml as follows:<br>
`{artifactId}-{version}.jar` 
2. Login to Render using your GitHub credentials.
3. Create a new Web Service and choose Build and deploy from a Git repository.
4. Enter the link to your (public) GitHub repository and click Continue.
5. Enter the Root Directory (name of the folder where pom.xml resides).
6. Choose the Instance Type as Free/Hobby. All other details are default.
7. Click on Create Web Service. Your app will undergo automatic build and deployment. Monitor the logs to view the progress or error messages. The entire process of Build+Deploy might take several minutes.
8. After successful deployment, you can access your backend using the generated unique URL (visible on top left under the name of your web service).
9. This unique URL will remain unchanged as long as your web service is deployed on Render. You can now integrate it in Budibase to make API calls to your custom endpoints.
