## Analysis

In today's academic curriculum, students are often faced with the dilemma of what to do with their accumulated school materials, such as textbooks, notebooks, related equipment, digital resources, and many more. These resources become obsolete and frequently go unused, which leads to unnecessary waste and a financial strain for new students looking into purchasing them at full price. Additionally, while aiming for a degree at a university, students often look for ways to earn and save money while being busy with homework, projects, exams and other extracurricular activities. Therefore, they are often seeking uncomplicated and fast ways to buy and sell items that are needed for their studies. Due to this fact, the FHNW Thrift project shall provide them with the necessary platform that will offer them this opportunity. 

Furthermore, lecturers, professors and even the dean of different courses will have the chance to utilize this platform similarly to how the students are allowed to. By sharing helpful resources, materials, other everyday needs or even other helpful items for the application's users, the FHNW Thrift also aims to encourage recycling, upcycling and in general, a more sustainable environment. Therefore, the aim of this project is to make the application available to an extensive audience as possible. 

### Scenario 

FHNW Thrift is an online marketplace primarily for students at the Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW) to resell study material and other items. Yet, in order to reach a broader audience, the platform will be made available for teachers and other individuals within the FHNW organization. Through the platform, the users are allowed to create offers and sell their items. Additionally, through the contact form, the application's users will be able to contact the sellers to express their interest in the offers that are made available through the platform. Users are also allowed to report malicious offerings to avoid fraud, which the administrators of the program will also be able to delete and alert the users about their suspicious profiles or activities. In this way, the platform remains with only legitimate offers and profiles of individuals within the FHNW organization. Furthermore, the users shall be able to filter the offers according to their location, the condition of the item that is being sold, and the category to which the items belong. Therefore, the overall aim of this application is to provide the users with an overall interactive, yet user-friendly experience. 

Within the application, the users are limited to creating offers with the aim of selling their items and contacting other sellers directly through the platform. In the meantime, only the administrators of the FHNW Thrift are provided with extensive access to the application. Through the defined "admin rights", admins can view the entire database that contains the orders, modify rows (or also seen as offers) and delete rows. Additionally, admins will be able to view the entire database in which the user data is stored and commit necessary changes. Furthermore, due to the "reporting function" that is made available to the users, the admins have the right to review these reports and decide on necessary actions accordingly. Therefore, for the initial launch of the FHNW Thrift application, there is a defined separation of what the admins and users are allowed to do within the program. 


### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to create offers for my fellow students, teachers and other individuals within the FHNW organization.
2. As a user, I want to view all the offers and the details to an offer and to filter offers by location, category or condition.
3. As a user, I want to report suspicious offers to avoid getting scammed.
4. As a user, I want to contact a seller when I am interested in a product.
5. As a user, I should be able to contact the admin to edit or delete an existing offer.
6. As an admin, I should be able to see all the existing offers in the database and I should be able to modify or delete existing offers.
7. As an admin, I should be able to see the entire user list and I should be able to modify user details or remove users from the user list. 

### Use Case

- UC-3 [Applying a filter to the existing offers] User can sort the offers by school location, category and condition
- UC-4 [Report an existing offer] User can report an object as suspicious
- UC-5 [Contacting another user] User can contact another user through the FHNW Thrift application
- UC-6 [Contacting the admin] User can contact Admin to edit or delete own offers
- UC-7 [Viewing all the offers] Admin and User can view all the offers 
- UC-8 [Modify or delete an existing offer] Admin changes or deletes an existing object
- UC-9 [Viewing all the users] Admin can view all the users registered on FHNW Thrift
- UC-10 [Modify user details or remove user from user list] Admin changes user details or deletes user from the user list


## Design

The design has been sketched through drawio and has been created in Budibase. The design was done and discussed by the whole project team and is based on a simple application design to ensure a user-friendly program. Additionally the colors have been selected according to FHNW's color scheme to maintain the university's identity. 

### Wireframe

The wireframe was created through drawio in order to visualize how the prototype was planned to look like. 
Disclaimer: During the course of the creation of the program, the wireframe and the prototype design will differ from each other. The prototype will be highly based according to Budibase's functionalities.

### Prototype

The prototype is currently being created through Budibase.

### Domain Design (not done)

(The `ch.fhnw.pizza.data.domain` package contains the following domain objects / entities including getters and setters:

### Business Logic 

Based on the UC-4 and UC-8, there will be the opportunity that the user can report an offer and ask the admin to delete it and therefore, take measures to act on this report. 

- If the offer on the platform looks suspicious, the user is allowed to report it through a "Report!" button to the admin. 
- If the offer on the platform looks suspicious, the admin is allowed to delete the post. 

**Path**: (path for the business logic to be still attached)

**Param**: (parameter for the business logic to be still attached)

**Method:** `GET`

## Implementation 

### Backend Technology

The repository was created by using the Pizzeria Reference as an inspiration. 

This Web application is relying on [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) and the following dependencies:

- [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data)
- [Java Persistence API (JPA)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)
- [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com)

To bootstrap the application, the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) has been used.

Then, the following further dependencies have been added to the project `pom.xml`:

- DB:
```XML
<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

- SWAGGER:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
      <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
```

### Frontend Technology (still to be done) 
> ðŸš§: Describe your views and what APIs is used on which view. If you don't have access to the Internet Technology class Budibase environment(https://inttech.budibase.app/), please write to Devid on MS teams.

This Web application was developed using Budibase and it is available for preview at <iframe width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" allow="clipboard-write;camera;geolocation;fullscreen" src="https://internettechnologyprojectbitpt3b2025.budibase.app/embed/fhnw-thrift"></iframe>. 

## Execution 

In order to run the application, a running codespace must first be fixed. As soon as the codespace is proven to be running and the URL can be accessed through the 8080 server, the link must be copied into Budibase's backend. To ensure a smooth delivery of the program, the backend was first developed, which was then coupled with the Budibase application. 

Below are the steps that were done throughout the project:
1. PizzaRP provided by the supervisors was cloned in GitHub to create a new repository.
2. A codespace was started on GitHub to make the necessary changes.
3. With the codespace, the code and overall backend technology of the project were debugged to ensure that problems with the code were eliminated. In this case, the debugging was also supported with GitHub's Copilot. 
5. A ThriftApplication.java was created.
6. The ThriftRP was made to run that was embedded in the ThriftApplication.java.
7. The 8080 port was then made public in order to extract the link that can be used in Budibase to run the application.
8. The Budibase prototype or application was then created.
9. The URL was then updated in order to publish the application.
